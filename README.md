## Requirements
Node must be installed with a version of NPM.  See `package.json` for the proper version.  

I recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage multiple versions of node on your computer. 

## Installation & Activation

Each subfolder contains it's own running examples.  In order to see the state of the code / server at a given time, `cd` into the approprate subfolder, and run the following commands: 

```
npm i && npm start
```
